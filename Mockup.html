								<p>As you already have a good understanding of the type of work involved, you should start to compile a list of employers to apply to. Sending 100 badly researched applications is not the most effective application strategy. View the Employment Sectors section of the LSE website to expand your search from the well-known larger organisations to the smaller harder to find organisations.</p>
								<p>Speaking to LSE alumni working for a range of organisations can be helpful in expanding your list of possible employers and give you a head start for the application and interview process. You may even find work experience off the back of it! Set up informational interviews with LSE alumni within the sector. You can contact alumni through the LSE Alumni Association Official Group on LinkedIn.</p>
