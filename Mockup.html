The LSE <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/CareersAndVacancies/careersService/EmploymentSectors/Home.aspx" title="employment sectors">employment sectors</a> section of the website includes information about a range of roles available within each sector.</p>
								<h4>Meet employers</h4>
								<p>You are probably ready to start meeting with employers to find out more about their roles. For the opportunity to meet with a wide range of employers in different settings, view our employer events programme on <a target="_blank" href="https://careers.lse.ac.uk/BrowseEvents.chpx" title="careers events">CareerHub</a>. Useful events to attend at this stage would be employer presentations and employer-led seminars.</p>
								<h4>Get some experience</h4>
								<p>Reading about roles is helpful but getting real life experience is important to see if you like the work in practice. The internships and work experience section of the LSE website provides information on selecting and securing an internship. You can also browse work experience opportunities on <a target="_blank" href="https://careers.lse.ac.uk/JobSearch.chpx" title="careerhub opportunity search">CareerHub</a>.</p>
								<h4>Join a student society</h4>
								<p>Career focused <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lsesu.com/activities/societies/" title="lsesu societies">societies</a> may provide additional opportunities to meet with employers in an informal setting. Use these opportunities to find out more about the roles on offer. Joining societies can also demonstrate a real interest in a sector and usually there are opportunities to take on positions of responsibility, all of which is attractive to employers.</p>

								<h4>Find out what roles LSE graduates are doing</h4>
								<p>It may help to think about the roles that alumni with similar subject backgrounds have selected. The graduate destinations website has useful summaries for your <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/CareersAndVacancies/graduateDestinations/Department/Home.aspx" title="graduate destinations by department">department</a> and your <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/CareersAndVacancies/graduateDestinations/eGems/Home.aspx" title="graduate destinations by course">degree programme</a>.</p>
								<h4>Do some research online</h4>
								<p>It is important to understand the difference between employment sectors and the roles within them. For example, you may want to work for a particular sector but you are unlikely to enjoy every role that sector offers. Alternatively you may decide that the typical activities related to a role is what is important and you would be happy to do this role within any sector. The resources on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/CareersAndVacancies/careersService/EmploymentSectors/Home.aspx" title="employment sectors">employment sectors</a> section of our website provide information on roles and the typical activities involved.</p>
								<h4>Attend a panel event</h4>
								<p>Panel events and 'Careers in&hellip;' events involve a panel of speakers discussing all aspects of their careers. Forums give you an overview of a range of roles within a sector. They are ideal if you are starting to explore career options as you can hear about the activities people do in their daily jobs without being forced to ask questions. View our events on <a target="_blank" href="https://careers.lse.ac.uk/BrowseEvents.chpx" title="careers events">CareerHub</a>.</p>
								<h4>Attend a careers fair</h4>
								<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/CareersAndVacancies/careersService/CareersEvents/CareersFairs/Home.aspx" title="careers fairs">Careers fairs</a> provide a good opportunity to start meeting employers face to face. Employers usually bring representatives from a range of roles so it's an ideal opportunity to find out more about their day to day work and the type of projects they are involved in.</p>
								<h4>Target Jobs Careers Report</h4>
								<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://targetjobs.co.uk/careers-report" title="Target Jobs Careers Report">Target Jobs Careers Report</a> uses questionnaires and psychometric tests to explore your interests, strengths, personality and abilities. The report then matches you to possible roles to explore further.</p>
								<h4>Explore general graduate career websites</h4>
								<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.prospects.ac.uk/types_of_jobs.htm" title="prospects types of jobs">Prospects</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://targetjobs.co.uk/careers-advice/job-descriptions" title="targetjobs job descriptions">TargetJobs</a> list detailed role descriptions including typical work activities, employers within the sector, salary and conditions, entry requirements, career development and related jobs.</p>

								<h4>Start making a decision</h4>
								<p>Hopefully all of your research has helped you to decide which sectors, roles and employers are most appealing to you. However if you are finding this challenging then move on to <a class="trigger-link section3-trigger" title="open section 3">section 3 - Making a decision</a>.</p>
								<h4>Tailor your application</h4>
								<p>Tailoring your applications is one of the best ways to ensure you stand out against the competition. Make sure that your research is demonstrated in your application. For advice on creating well tailored applications review the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/CareersAndVacancies/careersService/CVCoverApps/Home.aspx" title="cvs cover letters and applications">CVs, cover letters and applications</a> section of the website.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="suggestion" id="importance-maybe">
								<h4>Give yourself time</h4>
								<p>Try to start early and don't wait for the deadlines. The research you conduct on an employer at the application stage is vital and may determine whether you are selected for interview. We understand that research takes time but the research you complete now will not go to waste &#45; it all helps to build your understanding of a sector.</p>
								<h4>Attend a careers seminar</h4>
								<p>For advice on tailoring your application to a certain employer book to attend a CV, cover letter or application seminar delivered by LSE Careers Consultants or employers. Check for the next available session in the events section of <a target="_blank" href="https://careers.lse.ac.uk/BrowseEvents.chpx" title="careers events">CareerHub</a>.</p>
								<h4>Meet employers</h4>
								<p>Try to meet with employers you are interested in prior to submitting an application. If you find some useful information this can help differentiate your application from the rest of the competition. You can see when your chosen employers are holding events on <a target="_blank" href="https://careers.lse.ac.uk/BrowseEvents.chpx" title="careers events">CareerHub</a>.</p>
								<h4>Contact alumni</h4>
								<p>You can also set up information interviews with LSE alumni within the organisation. You can contact alumni through <a target="_blank" href="http://linkedin.com" title="linkedin">LinkedIn</a> or using LSE's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/study/meetLSE/emailAnAlum/home.aspx" title="email an lse alum">email an alum</a> service.</p>

								<p>Doing employer research prior to making applications is essential. You may have a lot of activities to include on your CV but if you have not yet tailored your CV and applications to the employers you're applying to it is likely to end up in the 'no' pile.</p>
								<h4>Put yourself in the employers' shoes</h4>
								<p>If you were hiring someone to complete a job for you, it is more likely you would pick someone who had spent time researching you, your working style and your preferences over someone who had put no thought into it.</p>
								<h4>Do some research online</h4>
								<p>Start by looking at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/CareersAndVacancies/careersService/EmploymentSectors/Home.aspx" title="employment sectors">employment sectors</a> section of our website. You will find information on the range of employers, from large to small scale. For further ideas on how to target and research these employers look at the career research section of our website. To get a real understanding of an employer you will need to use a variety of sources.</p>

				<p>Decision making plays a key role in career planning and having too many choices will confuse you and slow you down. We all approach decision making in different ways.

								<h4 class="toggler hidden">Looking for the perfect job? There are many jobs that will suit you.</h4>
								<div class="suggestion"> 
									<p>Remember that there isn't a single perfect career for you. There are usually a range of possibilities that would suit you. Looking for the perfect job can actually prevent you from trialling some really exciting opportunities. The perfect job rarely exists and your preferences and the nature of the job are likely to change over time. Don't make the mistake of passing up great work experience opportunities as the role does not match every criteria. You will find you have to compromise on some things; this is not an exact science.</p>

							<div class="advice 2" id="wrong-decision">
								<h4 class="toggler hidden">Trialling career options now will help you in the future</h4>
								<div class="suggestion">
									<p>Remember that the career choice you make now is not for life! Most LSE graduates will make several career changes throughout their working lives. If the first role you do does not work out, then you will have a better understanding of what is important to you when you make the next choice. Focus on a few ideas at a time.</p>
									<p>Remember that you can always review and adapt your plans and goals as they develop and take shape. Why not use your time at university to try out a variety of roles so you can get a flavour of the work involved? You can find a list of work placements, part time work and internships currently advertised on <a target="_blank" href="https://careers.lse.ac.uk/JobSearch.chpx" title="careerhub opportunity search">CareerHub</a>.</p>

							</div>
							<div class="advice 3" id="compromise">
								<h4 class="toggler hidden">Compromise is important in effective decision making</h4>
								<div class="suggestion">
									<p>If one particular factor, like job location or using languages, has a major priority in your choice of career, you may have to compromise on some other factors to help you get started. For example, you may have to take a job which is not in your chosen sector, in order to make use of your languages in the first instance.</p>
									<p>Alternatively, in the short term you may have to compromise on your main deciding factor in career choice to enable you to realise your ambition longer term. For example, if your main priority is to live in London, but you also want to work in international development, you may have to gain experience in the field first, to enable you to move back to London at a later stage.</p>
									<p>If you are interested in working abroad you should view the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/CareersAndVacancies/careersService/InternationalCareers/Home.aspx" title="international careers">international careers</a> section of our website.</p>

							</div>
							<div class="advice 4" id="people-think">
								<h4 class="toggler hidden">Happiness and success in a career revolve around <em>your</em> choices</h4>
								<div class="suggestion">
									<p>If you are concerned about what other people think then you need to assess how important these influences are for you. Is it important for you to work in a similar sector to your friends?</p>
									<p>In career discussions we commonly hear students admitting to applying for certain sectors or roles as many of their friends or class mates were also applying. You have to be genuinely interested in a role to actually enjoy the work. Happiness and success in your career is personal and not related to what your friends are doing.</p>
									<p>More significant can be the influences of parents or partners. You need to be honest with yourself and with them about how important their views are.</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="advice 5" id="opt-out">
								<h4 class="toggler hidden">It's important to take control of your situation</h4>
								<div class="suggestion">
									<p>It often feels easier to put off making the big decisions. Even if you are planning on looking for a job following your exams there are still small things you can be doing whilst at university to make the process easier when you finish. For example you could try out a role of interest by arranging a week's work shadowing or you could take up a position of responsibility within a society or club. This will help you to identify areas of career interest and develop your skills now.</p>
									<p>If you plan to travel make sure you know what your first steps will be when you return. The sooner you start thinking about it, the more likely you'll be able to avoid being overwhelmed with career thoughts after your trip.</p>
